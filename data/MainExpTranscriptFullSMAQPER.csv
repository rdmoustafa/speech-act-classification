Charlie if you identify any properties with high numbers of people in let me know in Woodside I can move one of my trousers to protect them after moving to just to close out and November 7th probably to reposition 5 and 4 further South is dead now we can move down to the Southeast over.  that's getting replaying on the way back moving to the Central weekend Bassline around Esterly so easily clear and I've got a couple more builders in WestHill to declare a moment in a church I haven't played yet but otherwise we're looking alright has anyone Blackhill looked at Blackhill .

Roger got my fire-truck on the way to the South current location of the Fire hits the forest of SunWood  that will probably set up for it and it might be worth concentrating that there's nothing South Newton to catch Esterly clear in terms of people left to clear out till and easily both completely clear so do not worry about those two locations over.  .

Charlie at anecdote of my article is about a wrongful arrest which seems to have caused some sort of local outrage but it's listening a number of ok so the individuals that were arrested were or him Hanley and Swanton and they are now in custody in Castleton so potentially I do not know risk of demos in Castleton but nothing really that conclusive in the article . Charlie understood next we should put the focus on our initial plan of work my pride staff will be CastleHill Underwood so I can end but to vehicles there it would be worthwhile one of us look at BeaconHill if I do that with my 3 vehicles I look at CastleHill Underwood and BeaconHill over.  agree with that it's probably worth also looking at Hanley in Swanton if they got a church and hospital happy to do that unless you want to do that offer no happy noting that almost in population is in the Southeast half of the map of send one engine optimal stand have a quick check through and then position of the two in the Southeast Beacon Hills also worth a check just as those for large buildings actually I said that I do BeaconHill with my third vehicle so just a reminder CastleHill Underwood and middle centre I'll send my truck over.  to BeaconHill to get an assessment done for large buildings are currently no one's mention Winterfold which probably should have vehicles to check through as well over.

Charlie . Roger replens then I guess so yes I remove the Central to replay Centre and be prepared for whatever comes next question what is the max capacity fire-truck because I'm on 40/40 note that the wind direction has changed for now running West to East so left to right top left hand for Foxtrot 11 as X-Ray and bottom right fire at x-ray 30 as Yankee .

Charlie start moving six in that direction over.  . Bravo team looks like we're getting the Yankee under control . Roger yeah just seen you before 4 if that hit NewForest a bit of trouble so if you manage to contain it prior to get it in then we are . Roger largely by Yankees now moving at pace towards Newton  evacuated over.  . Alpha control I've lost control by computer I can't believe anymore firetrucks because I'm basically lost control by vehicles there for a few minutes the fire X-rays is pretty much are control Woodside down biggest risk to that fire most pertinent and down south in Yankee it would appear that neutral is now directly under threat over.  rubber yeah that would be the case . Bravo . Alpha can you lose 3 to the water bowser to team I've activated what I can from Newton  and moving it to the southwest safe location continue to the Northern Town which is obscured by fire do we need to make a call between Newton  and OldTown concerning the population century OldTown has not yet been but OldTown looks like it's a Newton is actually lost I'll move what I can evacuation wise but I'm timings wise not able to get there in time I will do 6 into Woodside stop fighting find out there again where fire-truck 6 cancel location to Charville without population centres up there ever a .

Alpha I think without cognitively fixed by that location on the map there is a there is a sort of Central gathering of population centres of CastleHill Underwood and the forest the social gathering of stuff there that makes sense . Alpha wind direction is currently moving in from the West and angel looks like it could be densely populated over.  .

210923,19,1,3,Shared View,1,civ,. this is Alpha my one is about a school football team information that I can galleries relevant but they are based in Breyden so I am assuming there's a decent population size there it is . Charlie minds on occasion Echoes is January 13th 2025 to Saturday having a family fun day together so there a lot of people there is risk of religious intolerance and hate crimes however hasn't told me where is but have you got information to back that up people are there . this is Bravo my information is about a royal visit to a local shopping centre however it does not say what the town is but I'm assuming shopping centre will be one of the bigger buildings and there's only three towns with them but there is no mention within the article about any negative or antisocial behaviour . this is Alpha my first my first port of call would probably be to check the three major towns with big buildings over.  . Bravo and then what about checking Breyden as well given that it has got both a religious Building and also that we mentioned before 14 was . this is Charlie so do you want to take Holvern Breydon and then Worthington Worthington nearest to the drop-off point for safety if one of you guys . this is Bravo I'm happy to take Thetford I think typing answer if you're happy to take Breyden and Epping yeah . this is Alpha I'm happy to do that in terms of fighting the fire I think based on the we should probably just dispatch all units to try and cut it from the source over.  . this is Charlie get happy that firetrucks is some label to check Holvern which has got another church there her . this is a . Bravo I can also check that whilst I'm checking the other area is . Charlie thank you also check Denston close closest to Worthington could I ask this size of ask your dad to buy anywhere that has got people if you let me know numbers and location and I make a note on my map so I know where to head to friend on fire . this is Alpha in terms of the water I kind of ask where is best position your water tanks over.  what you mean by yourself I realise that didn't make sense just when we're fighting the fire do you want to call need water or would you like me to tell you where I'd like them over.  your plan . this is Bravo just to reply to your question . Alpha I'm happy but it's the both of you need it for my tummy but I will position them near the fire in there firetrucks in general anyway it is . Charlie I'm heading down to Denston and Worthington I'll have to counter such as checking Worthington and when I'm dancing . Bravo I'm doing the same with Thetford asked me hi . this is Bravo . Charlie I've found one person at the campsite in ThetfordWood which is t14 . this is Charlie noted thank you . this is Charlie I have documents and Denston in the main buildings size . this is Charlie do you need any help searching breeding I can move my people from Worthington . this is no I've just finished the report on people is there are 3 people in 2021 there are 3 peopleS21 there are two people in S22 there is one person in 021 there are 2 people in 023 and one person in 25 over.  thank you . this is Alpha in terms of fighting the fire wind to be a North Westerly so the two immediate towns in danger Denston and Thetford on if we could dispatch . Bravo if you could dispatch your two units to that the one near Thetford C3 and . Charlie that's your unit to the unit please z20 please thank you I haven't finished checking that food for people completely however we have got currently one person at i930 for people at k-9 37 at Breydon and 31 at Denston noted thank you it's a . Charlie I've got one rescue truck Breyden and . this is Bravo . Charlie there is also someone one person at M8 how many people do we have in Thetford to the far is getting awfully close we have even 90 people in Thetford . this is Charlie I got one unit had not there to the rescue . this is Charlie I'm infected and starting to like people I run out of water near Denston is your water truck able to come down . this is Bravo yeah there was tracks on the way . this is Alpha is there anybody in the village of Denston . this is Charlie yes there's about 8 people and Denston you want me to redirect from braids on to the rescue currently the village is about to go up in flames so if you're not here already I think it might be over.  . this is Charlie I've got one rescue not heading over.  to Denston in there myself thank you very much for trying to keep it under control going to my screen for what I can see Breydon looks so much safe at the moment . this is Charlie my rescue unit up in Thetford is near infills I'm going to send my birthday tea . this is Alpha where are the most amount of people in Thetford Alice's . Bravo three main building so where 95 and 2 are on at the minute . this is Charlie with currently blown up and canine is . Charlie I'm also loading people in Denston ok . this is Alpha there's about to get hit by the fire so if you've got spare units I might be worth heading down towards their over.  it is . Charlie I can send my fire-truck down there is . Charlie Thetford rescue has a loading head and back there rescue secondary Gina is unloading and no head down to Worthington unless you'd like me to Denston in again this I think Denston is burnt out so Worthington the next stop . this is Charlie good work team on . Alpha how do you want to separate out firetrucks to deal with these potential fires this . Alpha-2 and E16 looks like it will probably get the Hut near Holbeechwood so if we could just rescue the people from that and k35 is looks like it's going to go up through the bright would so if you can make sure Epping and Breyden are evacuated so I think if we group your firetrucks are as it is . Charlie got someone heading up to Holbeechwood is there anyone in the campsite at Brightwood . this is Bravo not sure about Brightwood however have your notice at the wind is it has changed Direction as well is . Charlie I sent over.  my fire-truck to Brightwood the campsite just to see how many people are there on this I have noticed it's coming from the South so I think if we could send firetrucks one 6 and 3 towards Brentwood and 24 and 5 towards Holbeechwood over.  and Brightwood . this is Bravo fire-truck to buy heavy realised you are out of water is . Alpha fire-truck 2 is heading towards number_7 now . this is Charlie also heading to water the random building by Holbeechwood is empty . this is Alpha do we know what the status of citizens in Breyden and Holvern are over.  . this is Bravo fire has started in a E16 and spreading very fast . this is Charlie my truck is now full again I've had it down to blow white Brightwood . this is Alpha there are 4 people in Epping that I assume we have an evacuated I can give you the details of where they are if you would like that over.  you let me know what are there in I can head over.  every after so there is one person in GU22 one person in the 20 and 2 people in BH21 thank you . this is Bravo moved water tank 7 dancer Brightwood is . Charlie I'm currently on loading up in the Thetford where do we see me today and refuge on his head Epping and down to Breydon to ready up somewhere or head up towards Hover. n houses by sorry . Charlie can you repeat the question please as a child in Thetford my rescue vehicle do you want me to head to Holvern to rescue so how many people are up there or to Astley or whether I should head down to Breydon and Epping with my other rescue vehicle . this is rather not sure how many people are in this town so we'll probably be good to get some recon about that is a . Charlie and noted all them head out that already . this is Alpha looked at the fire has reached Holvern understanding the last person heading over.  there is . Charlie I'll head to the church of there being more people in there . this is Charlie I'm also unloading my second vehicle up in the top point . this is Charlie it looks like the fire spread not to Astley it's currently . this is Bravo ok I'll leave a fire-truck over.  Astley thank you . this is Charlie I have 108 people in they'll a g504 which I'm currently loading up ne10 is . Charlie just repeated 100 people up in the top corner . this is Alpha dispatch my third truck up . this is Charlie are you content for me to send my second received is up to the top corner fire-truck one there's a water tank next to you thank you firetrap 6 only have 16 is about to run out of water I'll head over.  to them middle and 07 is due . this is Charlie at my vehicle has had not to autovan and the other one is coming back down to unload rescue people . this is Bravo thank you for the update I've got firetrucks 405 fighting a fire in Astley . this is Alpha the only other house with people in in the Epping is is F22 restaurant confirm is . Charlie yeah I just sent open-water there I'm not going to deploy if you guys are content with rescued as everyone down there . this is out of it appears the fire in Epping has taken the village so stop it's going to be up to LangdaleWood to check those two areas and if not I think that that is probably the next one over.  . this is Charlie filling up in the state of play with the fire is it looks closed at or burnt that Direction . this is Bravo yeah I think it's all closed out about over.  there so yeah I think focusing attentions on Thetford would be is . Charlie at noted I had done in a minute LangdaleWood is a . Charlie noted thank you,1805,2448,69.23,16
210923,20,2,1,Restricted,1,civ,. this is Alpha my newspaper report is about hospital in LowTown  and that's probably over.  . Charlie my newspapers regards to conference doesn't say where but it's a lot of people so looking at the map either OldTown or I would say . this is Bravo my article is about squirrels thriving in the woods in Firwood and how the squirrels are yeah they're in this office safeguard and protect the wildlife kind of thing looking at this girl the bass there in with the pine trees which burn 3 times fast as well the other areas are the NewForest which has got many pints is in a campsite and then some watch WychWood campsite so might be good ones . Bravo has anyone got any ideas for Tactics or any sort of potential plans you have 3 minutes to further plan your approach with the snowy map and newspaper intelligence report I would say sorry it's . Charlie based on the hospitals we've got Greenhill on LowTown  which we should put the record numbers on and Charville and OldTown for the conference areas as a priority if you agree absolutely agree with that do you want me to take so is . Charlie Greenhill . this is Alpha I'm just thinking whether it is going to be more shrewd to split your rescue vehicles on different sides of the map to be able to respond to different fires over. does . Charlie actually do travel and then OldTown . this is Alpha yeah that's probably a good idea and then pats . Bravo check the cops and Newton  and pick up the rest after . this is this is Alpha yet that works for me . this is Alpha in terms of tackling the thing is I think we're going to need to be a lot more communicated of where the I'm going to try and mark on my map where the fire is got too so if you guys could just keep up reporting in on where you can see it then that would help me her track our response to it go to the rescue shall I aim for the lower populated areas to rescue and then the higher popular series to try and do the defence for the fire and his . Bravo yeah that could be way round to do it . Alpha what do you think yeah I agree I think we can try and push the fire to the side of the residential the heavy ones then we can rescue the people from the Last ones and if it gets out of control we can sacrifice of songs we got the people out of his . Bravo just thinking about giving up we've got a unit only view if we could potentially keep units 3 squares away from each other always so then we have a wide wireless view as possible because of their right next to each other we've got a limited view where is it that little bit extra spaced apart will have sort of like 6 squares in the of you if that makes sense no . this is Alpha can I just I was doing LowTown  and which other villager Greenhill as well please . Alpha Greenhill and Woodside . Bravo LowTown  and Newton and after . this is Charlie Adam Barton free alternator check which would the campsite . this is Charlie no people and watch would . this is no people in hospital in LowTown  112 hospital in Greenhill . Charlie noted thank you for that we use that as a protect the fire-truck if there's a fire nearby will be ignited at grid references M4 and u25 in 3 minutes guys will be ignited at grid references4 and U 25 in 3 minutes . this is Charlie I suggest that given the wind direction we put some firetrucks up in northeast corner Greenhill . this is Alpha yeah I was thinking exactly the same . this is Bravo . Alpha let us know which theatre up in that direction . this is Alpha I suppose let's check if float I'll actually has any people in and because actually if it doesn't or it only has one person we need to then we can focus more on Greenhill that question LowTown  has 4 people in it two people at M29 one at 10:30 and one at l30 M29 and l30 is a . Charlie noted or send some people there to do some restaurant is . Charlie I have handful of people over.  an OldTown . this is Charlie there's quite a few people as well so it looks like the Charville Green Hill so I think I've only found currently7 people in Woodside so there's not too many in there to LowTown  those people so you can focus our efforts above . this is Bravo that sounds like a good idea . Charlie . this is Charlie at the WyreForest over.  there . this is Bravo I'm currently searching in Newton and have only found one person so far ok . this is Alpha the fire started his . Bravo send me a location and I will send there . this is Charlie where would you like my fire-truck on this . Alpha if we've evacuated LowTown|1then currently I do not know the extent of the fire but I think it's about a K6 and it's about 16 note . this is Charlie in terms of evacuating people I found two people in Newton  a j33 in a 32amp not imagining the fire will go too far down majors need to reassess later . this is Charlie I'm heading to LowTown  the fires fast approaching me . this is Alpha the fire is currently at aa86 . Charlie the fire isme in key 28-29 . this is how far you going to be able to evacuate that Talent I'm . this is Charlie I'm there now I'm doing it as quick as the ones closest to it . this is Alpha if someone else come and take the lower half of this fire up and Greenhill so around ak11 and 12 already there . this is Alpha the fire seems to be extinguished between a H7 and aj90 working on the diagrams to get around the village l30 M29 and M30 . this is Bravo nine M30 and l30 is .

Alpha have you got any individuals on the fire GreenHill over.   I think we've managed to extinguish it basically in a line parallel with the town I'm just trying to see if it's got around the edges over.  thank you . this is Bravo if you could send a track LowTown|1to help there that would be appreciated . this is out of all my trucks in the top the top corner is that they will take a long time to get there is that going to be necessary by the time I get there either . this is this is Charlie at LowTown  I believe it as backdated now . this is do not worry about the tracks then . this is Charlie are both my Rescuers or unloading in the rescue point little town near Greenhill are you needed me anywhere . this is currently can't find any Greenhill think we may have contained it but if everyone could keep searching round and I am in a h 15 and there is no fire in my little Square around that it is play I'm a V8 and there's no fire around there I'm also around the grey rescue point there's no flies I can see they're either . this is Bravo I have a feeling that the fire is heading towards the course it is send my fire-truck . this is Alpha I think we may contain the fire up and Green Hill I'm going to just had one towards Charville just to check it hasn't spread over.  there and one down towards OldTown all my firetrucks have full so .

210923,21,3,2,GodsEye,1,civ,. this is Charlie my report is based on car thefts in the CastleHill area possible risk of fire there . this is Bravo my article is talking about a wrongful arrest of someone who was walking from their home in to a store in Swanton and then they were arrested and taken into custody Castleton and the incident has sparked outrage among civil rights leaders and members of the local community so potential of people in these towns and potentially busy locations that we need . this is Alpha so mine is talking about a music festival in HazeyCopse which I do not think is on here but I assume that means we should probably get the campsite in TrenchWood  and Wildwood  just thinking about Tactics if people could communicate when they're on like 10 to 15 L of water left in their tanks then that means that I can try and get a fire-truck over.  to you water truck sorry over.  to you with enough time you have 3 minutes to further plan your approach with the snowy map and newspaper intelligence reports available . this is Charlie do you want to do approach to check in the buildings etc noting Castleton I've got the petrol arrest this year . this is Alpha yeah that seems like a good idea the other thing is BeaconHill Malton and CastleHill all have large buildings especially if there was another thing at CastleHill was the car theft me to take Malton Winterfold and check applicants would yes yeah that that could be a good idea sorry . this is Bravo . Charlie repeat which areas you are going to search it is . Charlie I will check Malton Winterfold and trench would does the next person want to do BeaconHill CastleHill maybe . Bravo and then . Alpha just at the bottom of the map Swanton Hanley Wildwood  campsite as well we can do yeah . this is Alpha happy to do Wildwood  hand the Swanton and then move on to Castleton . Bravo just to double check I am taking CastleHill and Underwood search yes please and BeaconHill please no worries . this is Alpha I suppose the major city spots all seem to be this central evacuation point is that worth changing strategy to a previous one what do you mean by that . Alpha yeah sorry I'm so because they are all very close to the extraction point that he actually want to try and evacuate or are we still trying to stick to the same tactic as before . this is Charlie I think if we can try and chat with the fire hydrant popularity areas and try and rescue from the least populated that just giving how slow is get them on the firetrucks I got more chance of rescuing in small towns if we can protect the bigger ones if it got the firetrucks to do it but we can change that up if we need to . this is Charlie there's no option for TrenchWood  . this is our first cause there at Wildwood  104 in this campsite over.  is a . Charlie noted given the Numbers I'm not going to be able to get any more than 10 max wasn't able to prevent any size reaching them you know is there a sense check on the amount of people in Castleton . this is how I do not think anyone actually checking there yet but I can head over.  I'm just taking Winterfold cos that seems to be potentially where it might go the head in North West . this is Alpha the other town that looks like it could be in danger is Malton have you got an update on that this Charley just checking it that one person they're not loading . this is Bravo CastleHill is clear of people and so is Underwood CastleHill and Underwood have no people in them to confirm BeaconHill Underwood CastleHill have no people in it at Winterfold has for the people in it I have a fire try . this is Bravo I have a fire-truck moving to a k39 in preparation for the fire and I will have a movie to P20 as well . this is Charlie I have one fire in the top part so it is in u19 world you like me . this is Alpha if there are people in Malton to save then stay up there otherwise I think that's just focus on This Fire Down in the bottom corner ever106 people in sale M14 and Malton . this is Alpha can we send fire-truck number for a number_6 up to check Malton and I'll try and focus on this fire down here over.  is just above where the fire is so it's just been down . this is my number for is heading up towards number_6 now . this is Charlie do we have any firetrucks available up Turtles Malton please . this is Alpha I'm up there but I do not know we never actually worked out how many people in Castleton so I'll only move the one in there is quite a lot of people up there and it's moving on firetrucks as a water truck towards therefore refill please what's truck is on the way . this is Alpha just wondering what firetruck number five was doing down the bottom over.  had forgotten about it might have moved out now to help keep extinguishing fires . this is Charlie only one out of water up and number_6 and the fire is fast approaching Milton 77 is approaching fast . this is Alpha if they're all in one building in Moulton can we just make sure that we got a fire-truck on so that be extinguished that area straight away over.  . this is Bravo . Charlie what building are they in . this is Charlie there in L14 is . Charlie one of my people down towards it have no water fire-truck 8 is a G32 which is near you from the Wall Street number 8 thank you . this is going centre of a board to refill water . this is Alpha if we have not managed to protect moving can we get back step back down I'll ask if I've got no population then we should be alright to try and skirt it away is . Charlie and currently loading at some people in Winterfold . this is Bravo is winter for the next area we need to aim to protect then I found two people in a L19 which is in BeaconHill so should probably avoid that . this is Charlie at yet as a handful of people in Winterfold I think Maltings now gone so I send my other actually person down . this is Charlie I'm going to send my phone was the Wyre Forest to try and make it shorts down at directions to head off . this is how far it looks like the fire down here is it's getting smaller I would suggest probably filling up water now over.  . this is Bravo it looks like both fires have been extinguished . this is Charlie noting that there's no one in CastleHill TrenchWood  and Underwood and I could get fire are continue heading down to BeaconHill my rescue team and staying with her dad ok . this is Alpha I suggest we go and move locations around to Wildwood  then because there's 100 people in that campsite . this is Bravo it looking at the locations of firetrucks to 3 and 5 would recommend they stay and that continue having Easter little bit as everyone agrees with that . this is Charlie I think if I've gone ahead Souls while there's no one in CastleHill Underwood I'm happy to try and continue rescue in the ones in Winterfold and BeaconHill how far is a good plan I think if we managed to sort of save Marvin I think the next biggest is Wildwood  said that in the forest . this is Alpha shall we get some firetrucks surrounding j24 so it will bring around it so that we can try and hit it off right at the start over.  I'm just so . Charlie and I'm just heading up to j25 . this is Charlie . Bravo can you confirm what cell had the options for BeaconHill please I believe it was a-L19 that's a-L19 thank you bye-bye . this is Alpha fire started remember the wind blowing from the North so let's try and get the south side of the fire over.  times of Hanley or Swanton I didn't get very long to check there couple in Swanton but not many that I could see but I haven't checked all the buildings this area has been contained well I think if you do would like to see to the other fire I think I can have this one contains her . this is Charlie and I will refill by the middle of . this is Bravo I will do that as well but a water tank7 is in the p-26 should you need it thank you very much I'm going to fill up both my trucks all of my trucks at Number_7 and then go ahead north with you guys RG24 paint that would be appreciated . this is Bravo can I confirm whether there were any people in TrenchWood  campsite . this is Charlie know the one and the people in there also BeaconHill aa19 has been cleared and I'm British all Winterfold is now clear as well that's amazing thank you . Charlie is . Charlie one of my rescue vehicles heading off to unload people . this is Alpha . Bravo or water thing at Number_7 is done with you so feel free to move out with you . this is great thank you will move it up towards the edge of the fire . this is Charlie and my firetrucks now for SE10 not was a fire . this is how I think firetrap 4 and 5 doing sterling work in the middle of the fire but I think to try and stop it spread if we get round the South like the South and a little bit of a u-shape and we should be able to contain it over.  . this is completely agree with that just need to fill up with water is . Charlie I'm heading towards the top where Beacon Hills noted are lamb head down . this is Bravo that are firetrucks at aj16 an AA 17 on either side of the fire . this is Charlie thank you bye . this is Charlie I'm just moving along the bottom where I am for number_6 . this is Bravo fire-truck 3 the water tank is next to you to refill . this is fired as is . Charlie if I do not think I'm going to  use another 7 water Lisa . this is the referee units unloading and heading to the bottom part just in case with Swanton . this is where can I confirm that fire-truck 7 Can Be Moved to give it out of the firetrucks . this is Charlie confirm thank you . this is Alpha confirm . this is Bravo thank you that's perfect . this is bro firetrucks ex would you be able to deal with those three squares of Fire by you please it is . Charlie I'm currently in aj18 in the file there to begin with . this is Bravo . Alpha do you need any support on the left why does a fire or are you all good . this is Alpha I think just a bit down the bottom but I managed to get my firetrucks here now so I just see how it goes over.  I'm just checking Swanton working from the right hand side hospital clear does work and we're cross on right tools . this is Bravo fire-truck Kevin is running out of water and so is going to the middle to refill fire-truck he still has some water left . this is Charlie can I borrow 7 before you head over.  please . this is bro it's completely so won't do anything to help sorry about that no worries I'll go find like . this is Charlie currently on my fire-truck is empty and heading for refilling the middle of . this is Bravo this fire-truck 80s alternative and also heading to the middle sorry about that . this is Charlie at Swanton is near enough in look at and my second rescue Hanley . this is Alpha the fire seems to be building again down south but I do not think anything is in immediate danger over.  . this is Bravo a boat water tanks refilled and heading back out into the fire to support . this is Charlie at located and rescue Dan Swanton head and both units back over.  to Hanley now,2095,1223,80.1,5
220923,22,1,2,Restricted,0,civ,. this is Charlie my newspaper bit is about in CastleHill I'm not entirely sure how unless it's a link along the lines of anti-social behaviour there for that might be where it's going to start at . this is Bravo mine is report suggests that individuals in Hanley it's wanting and there is definitely people in Castleton mine . this is Alpha mine says that there is a music festival in hazy coats but where is that . this is Charlie I can't see that now . this is Bravo does it mention a second location it just says the festival goes enjoy food tricks tenders camping and beer garden and then that that's it doesn't say where it is thinking sorry I'm thinking maybe it's Wildwood  cos that's the only one that has a campsite oh no chance would have a campsite as well never mind we can work under the assumption that it is Wildwood  highly Swanton and cover. ed in as the wind Direction is heading west I think we should work under the assumption that Wildwood s is HazeyCopse Music Festival for some reason it's telling me that Beyonce Bruno Mars and Kendrick Lamar are going to be playing so I do not know if we need to fack do anything just my Samsung be a fat information to relevant it's just give me that there's an awful lot of people in which case it's probably going to  be easier to just have an engine parked on that single tent rather than me trying to calculate I didn't also the last two times the directions to be the opposite of where it started in the stage I do not know going to be consistent but it's just worse than one day I just . this is Alpha I just thought shall I check out Wildwood  and TrenchWood  campsites show the other people there if the festivals that you one of them is . Charlie that be a good idea thanks over.  . this is Alpha there's a place called DripshillCopse do you think that could be at considering it's called HazeyCopse . this is Charlie I wouldn't think so could not get any chance so even if it is up there then that's not going to people there so when we start I'm going to check out Swanton and handlers the first call so but rather if you want a castle in Castleton campsites that probably be letter at the start of one of the police station in Castleton and 1 on the hospital if somebody to cover.  the other large Building and CastleHill . Charlie yeah that sounds good to me over.  my engine either on the Big One in CastleHill or potentially the church in Hanley of the hospital in Swanton starts Direction etc . this is Alpha what were he said would be busy again I've completely forgotten that . this is Bravo Castleton it is very likely to be busy BeaconHill is potentially to be busy and probably are individuals both in Hanley and Swanton . this is Charlie just looking at the wind direction now I'm suspecting the fires going to start south east of Castleton just bringing a northwesterly Direction over.  potentially wanted her I do not think we will be hit by the direction of the wind is . Charlie agreed ever also sweet my two of CastleHill Swanton large building seem to be empty also ears and dry what word has 104 people at the campsite over.  Castleton and there is no one in the hospital like CastleHill . this is Charlie yeah that's wanted in the church Hanley all seem to be empty I'm going to one of my vehicles up to Malton to rescue that I think of the main protein needs the going to start a case 39 because I think that's going to hit the most racist over.  . this is Bravo Malton is going to be here in front of the fire the starting at p28 ending in a North-South Direction . this is Charlie yeah I think Muslims could definitely in the way vehicles up there now to hopefully evacuate that but depending there's two large buildings so may need firefighters for that but I'm hoping that I might be the whole thing before I get over.  that's fine I'm currently movie one of my engines up to police station in Malton and I will keep one of my other units son down towards other fire I've been asleep Winterfold and I can't find any the Wildwood  campsite has over.  100 people so I recommend maybe doing you bear I know it's not like the original plan that I think it's such a like concentrated number of people and it's right next to a rescue so I think it might be good to get out the way . Charlie there's 100 people at Wildwood  then I'm never going to be able to get them all out on time I think we just need to take an engine on it can a time there's no way I can evacuate all of those over.  I can't find anyone that went to fold or CastleHill currently . Charlie sounds good would you mind angel then if you've checked those two over.  . this is Alpha yeah I'm on it now it's . Charlie Says 106 people in Malton L14 so could we put an engine on that please cos I forget to contact about that money yeah I'm on do not worry . Alpha I'm already there so I will move my engine back momentarily ok I've got a fire-engines on GT2 and on of a diva fire ASDA why the fire is currently yes as by the fire is currently at 20 and 0 to 27 . Charlie that are individuals at a d 33that's great thank you we're going to  . Charlie could somebody on my engine for thank you I just said the same thing is me . Alpha you may want to sit in the building what number is it's going to be j14 I do not know third individuals when there or not I am on it doing it now . Alpha . this is Bravo . Charlie there is one individual right as31a Castleton thank you . this is Bravo the Fallout the fire has reached malted if you have any fire in the area please put them on buildings confirm it's on the police yes . this is Bravo I can confirm that I am on the police station vs . Charlie when I confirmed the everybody apart from the police station is evacuated so we could just take one now and then focus on the Castleton fire otherwise over. did not see a fire in Castleton to you it is . Charlie yeah there is one that's just incoming at underlining the word Castleton over.  I will move my fire-engine see what happens closer in an hour yes . this is bad I can confirm this . this is Charlie I believe Castleton is evacuated if the anyone sees any people please shout over.  . this is Charlie somebody save that CastleHill is empty over.  . this is Alpha I've missed someone but I appreciate that is anyone there . this is Charlie did you check V5 houses to the right my Underwood over.  I did not I will be checking our . this is Bravo I've heard do you need to tell your water . Charlie do you need to recall your water I partly have the 8th position in Castleton and I have television in Malton . this is Charlie I've still got 16 as I can do two blocks and I'm at the front of the 105 do you want to move one of your tank has down to Castleton so I think we could the mountain fire other than the police station over.  I am currently waiting for my fire-engines to make it to Castleton  CastleHill when is pretty much burnt out CastleHill is empty of people it's only the police station has got any people in it so if we just leaving engine on there I think we can ignore that fire over.  the police station is it's been closed out it should be able to re catch fire but I can always leave my engine here so where is your refuel one currently one of them is at N17 in turn the other one is at I think it's a a33 in Castleton I will be moving 8 up towards CastleHill . Charlie I suggest we abandon the motor and fine I do not think there's anyone else in danger up there and move all units I think Castleton is pretty much gone but if we look checked Winterfold and BeaconHill I think there's the next to inline over.  . this is Charlie can simply put an engine on the campsite in Wildwood  please see when it's changed it's still leaking out I have won on the wild with campsite can I just check where the can I get a location for the water trucks please one of the firetrucks is currently still in Malton at I will be moving it shortly and the other one is crazy cat dirty you know . this is Charlie I'm going to be exclusively focusing on evacuating Winterfold and BeaconHill so if anybody is in the Swanton and the area does any please can you let me know cos I did a quick sweep early and didn't see anyone but I didn't go have to have snow . this is Bravo I'm getting one of my engines on to the tent in TrenchWood  has one of the fires is up north the Earth wire j24 I do not think it's going to head out that we haven't already cover. ed please do not move . this is Charlie the fire at j24 is the winds change now that's going to go south and hit CastleHill Wildwood  a potentially handling Swanton depending on how long it goes over.  . this is also . Charlie I'm putting my fire-engine on 87 where that fire is begin so I can chat when that occurs over.  . this is no my engines I was awake mate I will currently being 7 shortly do you think Winterfold is going to be hit . this is Charlie I think so the fire has started now certainly the his started and spreading perfume the other one has to ever . this is currently if you can see it . this is Charlie the fire has so fast u88 and that is the front of the fire over.  which I just out haven't got eyes on the j21 . this is Alpha b I can see the fire at 26 and 25. this is Alpha do you have a fire-engine at Wildwood  . this is Alpha yeah ok I'm currently moving my water tank it down to Wildwood  can you confirm what position your on I'm currently on G32liquid and I have tankers trying to block the fire way from CastleHill at . this is currently moved my water tanker to GU31 it let me know if you want me to me that yeah that's fine thank you . this is Charlie struggling to see you how the fire is going I think it's going very suddenly almost southeast TrenchWood  can you confirm that someone checked the 20 attending it's empty over.  here and it's completely yes I am currently positioned at had the chance of that it is indeed auntie I can probably move what about engine stores BeaconHill if that is necessary although watching the fire door it does just said he had himself her to ShrawleyWood face the confirmation I'm just going to be sweeping unless one of the bottom two big houses in BeaconHill for the people I should be able to do that out when provides more of an issue but it doesn't seem to be as as at risk of fire . this is bad I do have one engine stationed in Winterfold I will currently just get the house is not closer to the fire . this is Charlie I've checked top 0 if you could do the bottom of 5 houses that would be appreciated over.  yes I will do that now . this is Alpha the fire centre Hanley . this is Charlie where is my fire-engine most required over.  that is his . Bravo by doesn't seem to have hit Winterfold yet but again and checking the most southern House is probably handy . this is where did you move your water tank to my nephew was speaking help quickly over.  . this is Alpha could you please give me the location on the water tank at sorry yes . this is Bravo the water is currently but your next to it over.  yeah I see it now qm yes that .

Charlie many thanks for that over.  . this is rather the water tanker 7 is currently going to talk resealing I will leave it in between Hagley and want . this is Friday I can confirm that there are no individuals and Underwood over.  is .

220923,23,2,3,GodsEye,0,civ,"about interfaith family fun day which is being organised to Jubilee either at a G4 or p22 so worth checking those acts I think that these one of those is going to be a high value target so which places will that again the village religious organisations so I think probably over.  the religious buildings at p22 in Breydon or the one at a G4 in Holvern but it doesn't specifically say it at whatever but somewhere there's going to be a larger Group Services . Alpha so mine says that there is a school team football and apparently like boys and girls age 9 to 11are doing well it's inspired A lot of kids to take up football and it says that they're team is in Breyden royals are coming to visit Canada so I guess we're in Canada now it seems to suggest that there is one that sort of local shopping centre and on the map I can see that is Worthington that has . Charlie Thetford got quite a large number buildings to could be that ok so then it sounds like pretty much all of the settlements for going to need a big check so if someone wants to take after being Holvern someone takes Thetford and Breydon and someone does Denston and Worthington I think there's loads of group so we want to come over.  . this is Bravo could I take test in and Worthington or Astley and Holvern and . Charlie in Worthington . this is Alpha slight recce Breyden and nothing yet I could would you be able to do those two and also Thetford since Epping is quite small and the two houses in LangdaleWood . this is Alpha beta . Charlie excellent in that case I'll cover.  Astley Holvern and the one Breydon building at aj14 if people could check the large first and then all the surrounding little ones ideally could you get the one building in where the cops as well please and other can you get the one that's in Brightwood as well I could probably cover.  where they add Brightwood to . Alpha is checking Thetford Epping and Breyden that would be really good if you could do that thank you . this is Alpha by the way . this is Charlie sounds good then my impression is that would potentially can have three possibly for high value targets so I'm guessing when we get the location off the fires announce I can do a quick Direct notice of where is likely to be in the firing range and then if we have high value targets that likely to be hit have dementia stations on them potentially . Bravo you were saying that you're struggling to die or said you two want to park one or both of your engines on the high value targets or similarly . Alpha says you've got three I'm just thinking in terms of cutting down the numbers that you have to juggle yeah I find a high value when I'm going to plant someone on there yes I'll probably leave one engine and Weddington if the fires are nearby if not I can move the engines you it'll be easier as we can see everything first . Charlie sounds good agree definitely not easy with the God's eye view of what's going on where everyone is thanks you're . this is Alpha there is one person on021 in Breyden thanks for that . this is individuals at Brightwood there are three individuals at Worthington and the two big buildings in Denston there are three and each building thanks for commissions just confirming that he building at x 3 actually I think that is going to be the first one in the right over.  somebody can go to Thetford . Alpha here on l10 in Thetford there's a house with 31 people how to confirm if it's 31, sticking engine on that please over.  I'm going to take the so you know the big buildings on in Thetford have approximately 30 to 40 people in them evacuate that money it might be worth seeing if we can create a barrier to make it just go all the way around the sides of that food and just avoid that entire that moment over.  . this is Bravo I'm going to move one of my units up towards near the fire and I can do it when itis . Charlie . Alpha could you use your number one found in to check the two settlements inland . Alpha please that . this is Bravo there are two people at a d20the says . Alpha is one person at 025 confirming both of those thank you I think if we can get the engine and that's just get it split it and make it a boy that food in when I can make a start I think I can get most of Denston I think that food and do not say going to be the first one it should Worthington and probably won't get size Breyden over.  there's only 68 people in Dunston it is the two big buildings and the small house at the right at the bottom of the rest of the houses are empty on my bed there are two people on021 in Breyden and there's also person on 022 and 21 both of those . this is Bravo . Alpha can you give me what do you fire next to Breedon place is Shirley confirming the other than 3 large buildings everyone infected is or will be evacuated over.  . this is where can I ask do we have we know how many people are in Denston . this is why there are 8 people indexed in . this is Charlie 6 of them are being have been picked up about to be picked up and then the little man by the time the fight so it should be fully evacuated we just want I think if we just focus on the Thetford 54 now that's the main danger to life over.  just . Charlie can confirm if there people in Andover.  Dover.  I think you would look earlier there were no people found in Langdale with . this is Alpha . Charlie confirm thank you confirming that at Denston is fully evacuated over.  accidentally evacuated . Charlie everything in apart from the three large houses which have engines on have an ordinal hasn't evacuated the large buildings with engines on have to meet people for me to evacuate so they've just got engines over.  moving to work on evacuating Worthington . this is Charlie did somebody check Thetford would never know I did not that I can do you know . this is Alpha just a unit on Battlefield 1 . Charlie do not move one of my legs otherwise I need to turn round now to get them anyway . this is Charlie can I confirm that whoever checked Breydon there is just the two buildings people and they check with the other side I can confirm there are three buildings in Breydon and I've checked with people is 0 23 22 and 21st then over.  a perfect as one person is Thetford would evacuating them now then I'm going to go down to Breydon Astley can I check did somebody have a look through Worthington by briefly checked it like I have any recordings of it but the fire has currently stopped I can leave you in at 10 then I'll have to double check next that I was just going to sleep now in case the second fire in Long . this is Charlie I've almost finished about closing braid and that should be fine if you had any people and if not can we Focus efforts on Ashley and Holvern never I checked Epping and I couldn't find any people but I'm going to do a quick sweep again while my engines nearby thank you I just really I didn't get a chance to speak of asking all events have anyi s heading up Aaron good start having a look around that would be amazing thank you favour I can confirm that Werrington I have not found a single person yet wedding Aston Hall event at the top wellingtons not going to be in the line of fire from the next one the next two fires are probably going to  shoot it Epping which Breyden which is about to be evacuated Astley and Worthington which are unconfirmed ever I will be back in it's up to Holvern and ask me over.  I found one person in eating at D22 . this is Alpha and I'll come and get me a moment I have you can check the other ones that would be appreciated as well over.  . this is Bravos X4 and Astley . this is Alpha there is one person at SE23 in Epping c23 yeah . this is Bravo there is one individual NW3 Astley thanks over.  it's . Charlie I think if we ignore the fire near where the captain Brightwood we should be able to get every day and time I'm more concerned Astley events if we can focus resources up there I think that would be good if you move your engines up there of your 23 and it's not there after that would be fantastic thank you ever there are two individuals at Z3 in Astley . Charlie could thank you say . Charlie . Alpha can I just confirm you checked all the places in Epping over.  in that case and Breydon are fully evacuated and so we can ignore the 750vaI will need how can over.  in there is one person at my current position on five . this is Alpha I'm really trying than they're on their way but just slowly turn that my one of my rescue vehicles is still coming up from I think there's been quite slow I didn't holler need to be on main priority now over.

220923,24,3,1,Shared View,0,civ,. this is Charlie my news article is UK news about the international Steel manufacturers conference starting today so potentially that's going to be a high concentration of people either the three large buildings in OldTown or Firwood if we really loves red squirrels that's like a hospital Cottage I'm getting up the one in Greenhill loads of people really like and their fundraising to keep it open and the residents are organising community events and bake sales and donation yeah so it's a hospital Cottage that's good in terms of splitting up to do the initial checks if whenever you want to take Charville Woodside and Greenhill and . Alpha does Newton and Blackhill I know they were quite big and then I'll do Wychwood Castleton Esterly  that works people ever yeah over.  . this is Alpha . this is Bravo yeah that's fine I can take west side and Greenhill . Alpha you happy taking town Newton BlackHill and the campsite in NewForest over.  ok so are we just that and then I just let you know over. all how many houses have how many people that be great especially if you can identify it which I've got a high concentrations of people yes if you can check all of the locations in each of the towns that would be really useful and then let me know either if you check the whole thing or where they are or if the fire start and you can get copy somewhere you got up to . this is Bravo he's checking WychWood check which would cause I'm starting by next and then I'll go and do WestHill Esterly LowTown  as . Charlie just in terms of pine trees in particular just NewForest and forwards are both pine trees so if NewForest goes up Newton a lot of trouble quickly potentially what side is a forward goes up as well hi there . this is Bravo it might be quite likely that further with my garden slaying sabre said only mentioned red squirrels as I'm thinking but the second second from the left top box is probably quite likely the starting point if they're South easterly  wind potentially off so bottom left if it's northeasterly  or stiletto basically I think we're going to be looking at something with the easterly  wind probably means WestHill and Esterly aren't going to be in as much trouble is there levels over.

Charlie cover.  your vehicle going to Thetford our . this is Alpha what's the population of Dennistoun at the moment denston has 5 people in it so that and Isabelle for the party they must be her Thetford fire then her that's fine near denston might not spoke too much but I've got a my third fire engine on the way to Uddingston now kids enter Recover. y vehicle to denston and then you are fire engines to focus on the fire in it going to denston to get those people out recover. y of started infected ok I'm sending one of my engines two words to check out the population there remember . this is Alpha remember we can only see round ourselves so we need to be old really near C3 so we can actually see the fire happen . this is Alpha . Bravo June by weather's fire engine number_6 do you want to go to the outside of the fire . this is Bravo I move my phone the weather fire as I didn't check Wellington have started in both locations now . this is our Farm moving units 1 and 2 to around unit for wind speed metre is the fire spreading quite quickly Close denston almost evacuated . Bravo did you want to Beauvais foraging 6 onto to the Southeast of instant agencies number_69 leaving it now . this is a WhatsApp what's the population of Bedford now for you if I committed too many of them . Charlie are the evacuated any denston is clear that . this is a doing now how many people Wellington I know we do not waiting on Thetford because I think it looks like we might lose Thetford yeah I think so move everything they denston Farm up to Thetford now to sort support that too soft try and say Thetford or is it the Denton by can't spread anywhere if it carries on going southeast it just the vegetation yeah I've moved the Fire Engine up to Thetford and my other words tank keeping on the wind direction just in case the fire decides to move down to Worthington that we've been we lose we might lose visibility of the fire yeah I think that's gone yeah agreed we can't seem to get on top fire because it's spreading on three fronts are too close to France . this is Alpha refilling number 2 is water tank empty . Charlie Worthington is actually pretty empty doesn't seem to be spending anymore Holvern Ashley at risk is now coming at 6:55 from the South so we need to protect the corner northern is north of those so Holbeechwood and  I think we set up a line of Defence just to the south of Holbeechwood yeah that stuff that makes sense to stop it spreading through the woods into hold on Leeds Festival my baby do we have an idea of what a population of holding is alright one vehicle going to hold at the moment do not know how many people in there . this is Bravo I think you should send some engines down to the Southside of BrightWood as well my engines are going to Holbeechwood one did somebody else wants to do Brigthwood one . Charlie there is a Brightwood with the necessary chat to people to check it only one wind and down that BrightWood Iris tired near Holbeechwood on the top of that five we can . this is Bravo there's no one in BrightWood campsite so it's empty so I think I should make the decision then to focus on Holbeach or two of two things we can save both Breydon . Charlie I do not think there's anyone in Breydon loads of people in holding their units to the wHolbeechwood . this is Alpha looks like we're handling like the fire Holbeechwood quite well at this . Bravo I'll leave one unit near Brightwood and then I spoke too soon forces at work yeah it's probably all units need to head to the north of Holbeechwood . Alpha leave your units letter refuel . Charlie hundreds of Fire heading towards us today as well so the fast button on to my fonts to wee but I was so anybody in actually can't remember sorry . Charlie I can't remember you that I've managed to keep far away from the church . this is Bob I'm sending the water tank it says that one chasing the fight quest have asked it but it seems to Saudi spread I'm starting it may have lost Astley . Alpha jackets has anyone in nasty remember to refill the water I've got fire engine into a water thing number_7 wears the number_7,1308,1296,61.23,88
51023,35,2,1,Restricted,0,mil,I've got a news article about a steel manufacturers conference my location on the map so yeah . this is Bravo here my article just talks about red squirrels driving in forward but it doesn't it doesn't say anything pretty much that links to where the population of anything like that so . this is over.  here mine is about a community group in to keep a hospital from closing in LowTown at the hospital in Low town is solve Fack . this is possibly if there's a protest going on and . this is our fundraising addition drives and compassionate leave the local authorities said protest necessarily so and how that might be 3 minutes to further planning approach for the snow map and newspaper intelligence reports available your plan Starts Now conference ESO Charville or OldTown look like they have the commercial buildings is already any clue at all as to which one in my by . Charlie here just double-checking but it doesn't look to be any your suggestion sounds right with the big buildings are so I would infer them that travel cos it's got for industrial units and houses is Morfa commercial centre because OldTown has builders and many more houses so that sounds good to me . this is particularly strong feeling about this still still works have you got people and happy that it is it or is there any information about that advertising basically the hospital was saved by those efforts so there's the valleys and all the effort has gone into actually save it looks like it's in history doesn't look like it's actually happening now . this is Bravo so so he sent you pop to Charville and OldTown and maybe we're still needs to be to have a look for populations that sounds good too soft yeah find out who's we're so because we do not have much in the way of intelligence to wear my trouble bike out yeah . this is Bravo yeah not much not much intelligence I do not think so we'll just have to scout scout a bit more trust we have and then go out on there depends on how much time we have before I will kick off angry . Charlie so what you doing oldtown Mill LowTown is free yes . Bravo sounds good to me you're planning time is now over.  the c35 scenario will begin in 3 2 1 fire engine down to Newton that and do some new and OldTown that direction of the population density if if I love you to take the other places yeah I'll send some stuff up to Charville a fire engine . Charlie are sent by engine to Lowtown then I've just had a hospital in Greenhill so maybe some bad feeling if the Green Hill has had any negative impact from the Lowtown hospital getting someone's attention yeah I'm sending a a fire engine there now just to have a look at population . this is Alpha I'm going to check that campsite at the New Forest on my way there I just noticed that the wind is coming from the Northeast this self I suppose what will have is actually weather Charville town the town with the participants or residence is going to likely be their location of the conference . this is Bravo so that put slow down and green Munster most at risk . Charlie there is about 6 people in Low town so sure about you . this is our yes yes evacuate The about getting now . this is Bravo yeah there's about 30 the office in in Greenhill one person so far in oldtown they do not seem to be anybody in the big buildings get-engine Stella locations internal locations of the fire upon the wind coming from the northeast I engine is currently and low town play towards Wychwood Forest did we explore . this is Alpha every Stratford the people from Lowtown should we Focus our efforts on the the fire that's near Greenhill shall we all go up there Motown go . this is Bravo I think we should all head up to Greenhill . this is Bravo yeah I think we should all head up to Greenhill a shame about the hospital because a lot of money has gone in there but what's the population of Greenhill do we know . this is Bravo I think it's about 30 30 people in the office No 1 in the charts in the hospital no one in the church where's the office in Greenhill the hospital going to the hospital now then you have sent my units up to the black corner then fully IM4 fire started am fire has started as well I have my dinner on the way now where is two-thirds of the way up the screen so where is everybody in Woodside my three engines is . Alpha are heading up to the fireworks in Greenhill I am currently fighting the fire at Greenhill ak50 . Charlie I've got recover. y at the hospital and in Low town unit_6 is near me unit_6 know Wychwood I move towards are in the Northeast is . Bravo yeah I think I think so if loads on his evacuated . Alpha will have to just be aware of the wind to make sure and he still in West and heading up . Charlie what location is a fire at the moment . this is Bravo is AJ 90 town is evacuated I'm moving safety . this is Alpha moving my units to the bottom left hand corner of the fire in Greenhill as best I can . this is Bravo just saying both water and machines at the Greenhill fire as well make sure we do not fire engines on the same Square it doesn't make it any faster as the her . this is as the firing of the town the other car do not think I've got disability and now the fire is just on the outskirts of Sound . Charlie head got some fire in the town in a g12 I'm making my firefighter to the church where is the nearest water tank number to my engine number 2 is your location yeah I've moved mine I've moved her my to his now when other 7 I'm heading to another 7 so my engines are filling up my age is a filling up from number_7 . this is Alpha 1 and 2 or actually that full because seems to be spreading further wintergreen Hilltown . this is Alpha . this is Bravo I'm sending one of the water tanks to fill up so there's only one water tank near Greenhill single dropped behind the fire in trying to get out of it in Greenhill yeah copy the same as I've got more fires on the way we seem to have a no on the screen saying just finished English but I'm still showing Red Square I think why 30 is quite a dangerous by because it will go through the forest into OldTown and new town and . this is all for the other turn the weather it was a danger to the schools the sacrifices grossir did we find out if Newton had is elf are any enter town and the campsite engine down to have a look at . this is Bravo I'm going to send one water tanker further my water tank up to hide the New Forest in front of Newtown by the campsite position my fire engine just outside the Charville . Charlie is that is that behind the forward are currently behind with you going front yeah . this is probably I think so now I should be getting a vacuum back to the campsite just in case I've got a unit going there now to see if there's anybody there currently have one in OldTown can you confirm as units in that outside yeah I've just got there in the doesn't seem to be any people in the campsite at all so so we only take me to no sense of units into Newton to have a look so it might actually be that we might be able to save to schools off for I have started i10 then we can infer that the other one has started to . this is Alpha at the Farmers started near the New Forest as well to the west of the New Forest we've got a Westerly wind so it's going to Eastwood I think we set off the light behind the New Forest for down in Newton shall we get a truck down there to save my hip fire has hit the forest in Fernwood living quickly as well . this is Bravo may be evil units behind forward outside yeah ok so . this is how far are we ignoring the new forest fire then going to forward to save this have you got a truck going to Newton to evacuate those three people online colour test down both the surfactant people in Charville . this is the fire looking like it might building . Charlie here is certainly had that way might just school underneath it might not be possible to . Bravo fire spreading into top left corner of the town now well we Focus our efforts forward or New Forest I've got units and both I'm stiff I'm sending all my love to forward on where is the third one is it started yet sister . Bravo forwarders burned down . Charlie . Alpha 50 Cent units are 6 confirmed R6 . this is Bravo check water levels there's a water check on track on q9 . Charlie here I need to read engine just bother is Newtown evacuated spread through the night Irish spreading to travel this . Alpha however under near declaration of Charville didn't get any people out need to keep away from those main buildings at this traffic on the water tank be moved to the further up yeah . this is Bravo moving up to key 5QU exhibition the fires of appearing rebuilding the unit where is that where's the water . this is Bravo is still a Q5 I'm leaving it to T3 alright . this is Bravo I actually need to go refill the water tank and the stuff out the clock receives most of the buildings in . this is Alpha to be a Pisces anywhere else that we do not know about I think there was one starting at u25b do anything with that one oh no we abandoned it to me I left her little . Bravo I left one engine and you down to about the fires on the main buildings,1754,1192,58.32,22
51023,36,3,2,GodsEye,0,mil,. this is Bravo my report is about local police because they wrongfully arrested someone in Hanley I think you may be by focused on the police station at Castleton possibly . this is how far I've got a music festival it's called the hazy music festival it's a big Glastonbury like because you've got list of it and like food when does all the rest of it so going to be because of that because of that line up it's going to be absolutely massive but we do not know it doesn't say where it is at all can talk to all units you have 3000 minutes to plan your approach for this narrow map and newspaper intelligence reports available you're planning time starts now . this is Bravo just looking at map I think a good place for that special be maybe like Linkwood because it's between to sort of towns so possibly more population there yeah I agree with that but there are interesting with the one penny campsites at 3-day event so I'm that reason it might be 20 or Wildwood on the basis that they're campsite yeah . this is Bravo yeah I think that's a good shout so maybe going sending units to either one of those to have a look at population status . Charlie remember since there's only one campsite always but one engine on it stop the fire rather than actually said the people from it out . this is Bravo I think sending people to check in at the Castleton population cos I think that might be quiet around the police station police station in Bolton as well . this is how far is that implicated at all bear in mind the actual undressed the false arrest happened in Hanley that might be the location of a protest yeah I think that's the possibility as . this is Bravo there's a police open day event which I think would be the police station which is the heaviest I'll get for a protest or some kind of something like that over.  . this is Alpha is that Castleton could be either but Castleton police station is closer to where the wrongful arrest happened you have a point so should we do some to just find out where the people are called then we can infer where these things actually happening I think that's a good shout ok . this is Alpha so when Castleton comes up when we start our go to Castleton with zoo Castleton and Castle Hill to engines and I might send another one down to see if there's a lot of people there you're planning time is now over.  see-through 5 tomorrow will begin in 3210 . this is Bravo I'll send her a fire engine up to Trenchwood campsite and one up to multiple it's worth 1 of a staying behind in Winterfold just was just a second just to see what kind of population we have in the middle there . Charlie I've got an engine in Winterfold I can do that another 6 days yeah . this is Bravo 106 people at Malton station so really high a population and The Sopranos no-one at Trenchwood campsite so that's not the location of the festival to be . this is how far anybody in that big building a CastleHill to the hospital yellow ok so those grid references put Malton Castleton CastleHill at the most threat . Charlie how many people Alton there's 106 people at the police station in a couple more houses around it OK I'll start evacuating a small houses or leave the building a copy . this is a I've got one person in one of the houses in Castleton where Engine number one is at the moment . this is Alpha yes . this is Bravo maybe we should start a defensive line between Castleton and Underwood . Charlie ok what about that police station in Castleton . this is Bravo have not checked it they Wildwood side doesn't have anybody in it did the Trenchwood campsite have anybody in it . this is Bravo I was at the Trenchwood campsite in that case we do not know where the music festival is it can't be anywhere else because there's no other places people will be shall we set between shall we get shall we protect Malta then police station police station and then everybody else between liquid and the police station in Malton and then we can ignore the ignore the one that's breaking out I'm near Castleton with a good chat depends how fast it goes if it gets that Castle Hill wind coming from the Southeast . this is how far so Castleton where's Castle Hill Hull yes I see how many people have you got in Castle Hill I do not know I think we can spend a lot of units trying to protect Castle Hill because one unit on multiple East station will save 106 people in the town so I say yeah the most good shout so which one shall we focus on . this is Bravo I think the Castle Hill Castleton fire I can't get my dinner setting there now . this is Bravo how's the evacuation of Malton going . Charlie is going pretty well at the moment almost all our buildings are quite get mine is there quick enough but I've got them on the way I'm trying to get my units . this is Alpha to the right-hand side of that not besides that fire on heading in to Castle yeah . this is Bravo I'm doing the same . Charlie here in Milton won the Big Build is on fire number for get on that . this is Bravo I do not think they have many people in the minute just the police station ok station safe than . this is Alpha and concentrate bottom left hand corner of that by now this the bottom I'm going to fire I'm leaving my unit 4 and my water unit back towards the active but not the advised pass-through mode to the ack fire now . Charlie the numbers 2 and 2 needs to fill up with water thank you . this is Alfred in there now I've got number to fire engine now beaten up on number eight water tank number 3 needs filling up as well . this is Alpha thank you I'm moving my engine to number seven looks like a firework been extinguished now love still got bits squares ok so I'm sending my bad herself I'm sending an engine to another 7 Turkey at Wakefield I'm going to start backward Winterfold  are we hello no delete this Southway got a northerly wind now so yeah potentially yeah that that no it's fine my he has put into winter felt so good shall . Charlie all evacuate Hanley as well . this is Bravo I'm placing a water tank and two engines on h29 just below where one of the sizes going to set before it reaches Wildwood do we account for the other 100 people yet if there's 250 people on the board . this is Bravo that is possible there's a lot of people in Beacon Hill I didn't have that I haven't had a look at the angel I wish one shall we tackle which fire . this is Bravo I think we should hook up with the one near Wildwood at first I've got one engine going up towards the fire near  Trenchwood that Forest . Bravo centre water tank up there as well it's the big one that's kind of I quickly because I normally window think has is Winterfold  still got a lot of people in it if so we could try Focus are if not we could try focus on defending Beacon Hill . Charlie there's a couple of God I'm picking him up . this is Bravo a fire Hazard reach wild let's see maybe fall back that was only . Charlie far as we reached a Trenchwood as well I'm going to position outside BeaconHill created are trying to create a while underneath Wildwood I'm sending water tank 7 to get refilled so I'm sending unit 5 up towards speaking help I'm moving a water chucked was your position because your truck so low and water is that number 8 you're moving along yeah I'm leaving it to p35 . Charlie we need to church in Winterfold  next to your number 5 ok I'll put number 5 on it is Apple looks like the lost control of that fire in the bottom left hand corner establish whether there was anything going on in Swanton,1420,1350,67.3,113
