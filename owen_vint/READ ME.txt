Instructions to run code:
Install all the neccesary libraries. The main ones are spaCy, Pandas and plotly.
Run each section of the notebook block by block. The 2 blocks that use 'split_text' and 'apply_speech_act'
may take a while to run but will complete eventually. (Takes about a minute combined for myself).
Once all sections are ran, the graphs I used at the time of analysis can be seen. 
Changing the graphs to different speakers can be done with the instructions in the notebook, 
but you simply just change the name at the end of the required lines as seen in the notebook.
If importing another text, the creation of the graphs will need to be edited as the character names will be different.
This is the same change as mentioned above and is stated in the notebook.
